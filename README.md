# SECTION 0: SOURCE
The material here is from the book: Full-Stack React, TypeScript, and
Node by David Choi. Of course, with a few modifications here and ther
according to my learning. Anyone, who desires to look into these 
technologies can as well use this repo.

It is not intended to reproduce the exact repo provided by the author 
for his book, and neither did it fork or clone it; but every line of 
code was built from scratch, following that given in the book and 
adding some touches where needed. 

# SECTION 1: LEARNING TYPESCRIPT

This repo contains code I have tried out or studied while learning
the following technologies from different authors and material:
JS, typescript, react, redux, nodejs, expressjs and graphql. 

# SECTION 2: SPAs and full React Apps
This section starts from chap4 with a sample SPA but with an included
routing capability (just for sampling, too). Then we delve into 
creating react applications with hooks and other capabilities.


# SECTION 3: REACT and Redux


# SECTION 4: Nodejs
